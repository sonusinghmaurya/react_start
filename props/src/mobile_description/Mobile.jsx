          The Jio Phone has been one of the most anticipated product launches in
          India this year. First announced at Reliance's Annual General Meeting
          earlier this year, it is a 4G and VoLTE enabled feature phone, but the
          main reason for the frenzy around it is that it is effectively free -
          the hardware, at least. Buyers will need to pay Rs. 1,500 as a
          security deposit, but that's refundable after three years if you
          return the phone and meet all the terms and conditions. Reliance
          started accepting pre-bookings for the smartphone in August with
          deliveries promised to begin in September.
